# Cancer-Detection-ML-Project
An optimized Gradient Boosting model for cancer risk prediction with 93% accuracy.
# Cancer Detection using Gradient Boosting

## Project Overview
This project identifies cancer risk factors using a dataset of 1,500 patients. It utilizes an optimized Gradient Boosting Classifier to achieve high sensitivity, ensuring fewer false negatives in a clinical setting.

## Key Features
- **Accuracy:** 93.00%
- **AUC-ROC:** 0.958
- **Optimized Threshold:** Adjusted to 0.16 for 95% Recall (Sensitivity).
- **Key Risk Factors:** BMI, Alcohol Intake, and Physical Activity.

## Visualizations
Included in the project are:
1. Correlation Heatmaps
2. Model Comparison ROC Curves
3. Sensitivity vs. Precision Tuning Plots
